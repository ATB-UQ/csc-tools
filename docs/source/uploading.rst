Uploading Datasets
==================

After datasets have been successfully exported, the archives in :code:`export_path` can be uploaded to the ACSC server using the `UQ RDM Cloud interface <https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/>`_

To upload a dataset, click on the link to your UQ RDM shared folder :ref:`as described previously <Accessing UQ RDM Shared Folders>` and upload the archives created in `Exporting Datasets`_ via the UQ RDM Cloud interface.
